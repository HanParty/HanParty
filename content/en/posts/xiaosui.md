Today's Xiaosui is on the 23rd day of the twelfth lunar month. At this point, every household is hygienic and has a good year's taste. After Xiaosui, it's new year. Xiaosui is a dress rehearsal on the first day of the lunar calendar. It's a beautiful wish for Chinese people to say goodbye to the old and welcome the new.



There are kitchen king, window decoration, Spring Festival couplets, dust cleaning, marriage, eating sesame candy and dumplings in the small age customs.



I wish you and your family good health today!
